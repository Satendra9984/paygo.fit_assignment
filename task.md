Thank you Satendra, for your interest in our opening. Great to hear that you are looking for a job which give you new challenges. As we hear you, this is the perfect chance for you to build and own the product end-end.

As a next step, we are expecting you to complete a short assignment. This is because we have received many profiles and would like to shortlist based on the performance.

Create a homepage and a list screen using Flutter. Firebase Admin to upload/update data.

HomePage Screen Requirements:
- Retrieve location of the user and show it top left as per design.
- Except location remaining all elements on the homepage should be static.

List Screen Requirements:
- Retrieve and display images, the name of the centre, its location, and the price from a Firebase database.
- Ensure that any updates made by an admin to the images in the Firebase database are reflected in real-time on the list screen.

Design Guidelines:
- Use any relevant icons and images.
- Ensure proper alignment throughout the design.

Completion:
Inform us once the assignment is complete by send us the APK file for review. We will get in touch to check the database integrations. Aim to complete the assignment by Sunday - August 4, 2024 EOD.
